About The Project
Email remains a primary form of communication, but drafting professional, well-structured replies can be time-consuming. Email-Reply-AI is a tool designed to alleviate this burden. By simply pasting the content of an email you've received and providing a brief instruction, the system leverages a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a context-aware, polished, and ready-to-send reply.

This project was built to explore the practical applications of modern LLMs in automating everyday tasks, saving users valuable time and mental energy.

Live Demo / Screenshot
Below is a quick look at the user interface and functionality.

Key Features
Context-Aware Generation: The AI understands the context of the original email to craft relevant replies.

Instruction-Based Control: Guide the AI with simple prompts like "Politely decline," "Accept and ask for the agenda," or "Say I'll look into this."

Tone Adjustment: (Optional Feature) Easily specify the desired tone‚Äîformal, casual, friendly, etc.

Simple Web Interface: A clean and intuitive UI built with Streamlit for ease of use.

One-Click Copy: Instantly copy the generated reply to your clipboard.

How It Works
The application follows a simple but powerful workflow to generate replies:

User Input: The user pastes the original email content and provides a short instruction for the desired reply.

Prompt Engineering: The backend constructs a detailed prompt for the LLM, combining the original email, user instructions, and predefined formatting rules.

LLM Inference: The engineered prompt is sent to a powerful LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Groq) for processing.

Response Generation: The LLM generates a high-quality email reply based on the prompt.

Display Output: The generated reply is displayed in the user interface, ready to be copied and used.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.9+ and pip installed on your system.

`python --version`

`git clone https://github.com/AnirudhAsuri/Email-Reply-AI.git
cd Email-Reply-AI
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):`

On macOS/Linux:

`python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:`

`python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:`

`pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your environment variables:`

Create a new file named .env in the root directory.

Copy the contents of .env.example into it.

Add your LLM API key to the .env file:

Code snippet

`API_KEY="sk-YourSecretApiKeyHere"`
üíª Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can run the application with a single command:

`streamlit run app.py`

Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
Here are some features and improvements planned for the future:

[ ] Direct Gmail/Outlook API integration to read and reply to emails from the app.

[ ] Support for analyzing and replying to emails with attachments.

[ ] User-selectable presets for common reply types (e.g., meeting confirmations).

[ ] Option to fine-tune a smaller, open-source model for more specialized tasks.

[ ] Deploy the application as a browser extension.

See the open issues for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
