## About The Project

Drafting professional, well-structured email replies can be time-consuming. **Email-Reply-AI** is a tool designed to solve this problem. By pasting the content of an email you've received and providing a simple instruction (e.g., "politely decline" or "accept the invitation"), the system leverages a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a context-aware, polished, and ready-to-send reply. This project saves users valuable time and mental energy.
